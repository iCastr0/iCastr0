# Data Science & Quantitative Finance Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I am an aspiring **Data Scientist** with a strong focus on **Quantitative Finance** and **Predictive Analytics**. My work combines statistical modeling, machine learning, and financial theory to build data-driven solutions for complex problems in markets and business.

## Career Objective

My goal is to pursue a career at the intersection of data science, finance, and technology, leveraging advanced analytics to drive better investment strategies and financial decision-making. I am particularly interested in quantitative research, algorithmic trading, and machine learning applications in capital markets, fintech, and hedge funds.

## About Me

I am currently pursuing dual degrees in Industrial Engineering and Informatics Engineering, which equip me with both analytical and computational skills. My interests lie in applying data science, algorithmic trading strategies, and financial modeling to extract insights and create actionable value in finance and beyond.

I am passionate about leveraging data-driven approaches to uncover patterns in financial markets, optimize investment decisions, and explore cutting-edge techniques in quantitative analysis and machine learning.
